# UnEx-ExcelUnlocker
UnEx is a Windows application for unprotecting (unlocking) Microsoft Excel password protected worksheets. UnEx unprotects Excel worksheets by manipulating the Excel file and not by finding the worksheet protection password. UnEx is written in C# and is tested on MS Excel 2007 and 2010 files. UnEx uses the DotNetZip Library to manipulate Excel files and unprotect them.
